# Myfav-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe, Ya you heared it right. One of the most famous and old game which was loved by almost every student and played whenever they had some time.
In this modern time of technology I thought to play it on my smartphone and started making. The good thing is that I complrted this project and here's the project on github, you can use. 
I just want to say if you're a beginner and have started learning android development try your hands on this app yourself. This makes you friendly with a lot of new things.
It's a two player game. Both of you and your friends can play this together.
One player chooses X and another O.
In the bottom of table a status bar is shown which shows the turns of players and Winner anouncment.
